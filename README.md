As a user, I can see all my results on my favorites page of upcoming games, live games, and the associated weather data during gametimes for a specific user input stadium



## Description of code -Bell
I have been tasked with getting the information from the server side third party weather API for a specific sports stadium and gametime. Responsibilities also include all of the logic required to store files in local storage when pulling from the API. I also used google maps and placeID APIs to create a map in the weather card so the user can see where the stadium is located with the associated data. There is an autocomplete input bar that once clicked creates a marker on the stadium and then posts all the data associated with that stadium.

I was responsible for creating HTML files using a Bootstrap alternative for easier custom styling of the webpage. Our team decided to use Bulma.io. After linking Bulma to each HTML, I began to create a website layout, following a created wireframe. In total, I created three HTML pages, but I made sure they are appropriately referenced, and the title stayed the same, so the user would not feel like one is traveling between different websites. The most difficult part of work for me was activating the modal through writing custom JavaScript, which was required because Bulma.io does not have in-built scripts. My teammates helped me immensely, and together we made modal work the way we needed.

I was responsible for creating and manageing the syle of the website. To do this, I created a custom css and used Bulma to and more stying to html. when new JavaScript was added, I added classses and tags to what was being appended to the page. Something I was also able to do was help with trobleshoot and formulate some of the logic the JavaScript uses.
